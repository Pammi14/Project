    "## Introduction\n",
    "New York is often considered one of the greatest cultural hubs in the country, having welcomed immigrants long before the days of Ellis Island. Immigrants now account for one-fifth of the state’s total population and make up a staggering 25 percent of its labor force. As workers, business owners, taxpayers, and neighbors, immigrants are an integral part of New York’s diverse and thriving communities and make extensive contributions that benefit all. The safety of New York City is not the only factor that attracts undocumented Mexican immigrants. New York City’s economy relies heavily on cheap labor provided by Mexican immigrants. Often, these immigrants are willing to take the dirty, low-paying jobs others will not. In the decades leading up to the 1970s, women, blacks and the youth population filled these jobs. However, as education levels have risen, these jobs have been opened up for Mexican immigrants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout its history, New York City has been a major point of entry for immigrants; the term \"melting pot\" was coined to describe densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the Lower East Side. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. English remains the most widely spoken language, although there are areas in the outer boroughs in which up to 25% of people speak English as an alternate language, and/or have limited or no English language fluency. English is least spoken in neighborhoods such as Flushing, Sunset Park, and Corona.\n",

    "With it's diverse culture , comes diverse food items. There are many resturants in New york City, each beloning to different categories like Chinese , Indian , Mexican, Italian, French etc.\n",
    "\n",
    " As so many Mexican immigrants exist in New York, opening a Mexican restaurant is a good business proposition. So as part of this project , we will list and visualize all major parts of New York City that has great Mexican resturants. Mexican food is popular because it's full of flavor. The Mexican dishes include healthy and fresh ingredients like avocados, beans, chilis, tomatoes and other vegetables, and different types of meat like beef, chicken, pork, and fish even rabbit, lamb, among others used in tacos, tamales or soups"
